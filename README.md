### TSP-Heuristics
This project is used to approximating the solution of TSP problems. First I implement swap Heuristic and 2-opt, then the Greedy method.
After the three methods, I implement my own algorithm. Then I write a graph generator and try to test and analyze the Heuristics.

This is the coursework 3 of the course inf-alogorithm and data structure.
